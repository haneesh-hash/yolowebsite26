4. Technical Integration: Stayflexi Booking Engine
Since Stayflexi allows for a group booking view, we will implement this as a Global Call to Action.

Implementation Strategy

The Global "Book Now" Button: Positioned in the top-right of your navigation bar.

Logic: This button redirects directly to your Stayflexi URL: https://bookingengine.stayflexi.com/group-be/?groupId=28012.

Webview/Iframe Integration: If your website builder allows for an "Embed" or "Iframe" block, you can host the booking engine directly on a page (e.g., yolocollective.com/book).

Embed Code Suggestion:

HTML
<div style="width: 100%; height: 900px; overflow: hidden; border: none;">
  <iframe 
    src="https://bookingengine.stayflexi.com/group-be/?groupId=28012" 
    width="100%" 
    height="100%" 
    style="border:0;" 
    title="YOLO Collective Booking Engine">
  </iframe>
</div>
5. Mobile App/Webview Optimization
Since you mentioned a webview, ensure the mobile version of the site uses a "Bottom Navigation Bar" for a native-app feel:

Icon 1: Home

Icon 2: Experience

Icon 3 (Center, Skyblue): Book Now (Triggers Stayflexi)

Icon 4: WhatsApp



Content guidelines: 
Page Title: The YOLO Experience
Subtitle: One Collective. Three Spirits. A Thousand Himalayan Memories.

[Section 1: The Philosophy]

Headline: Beyond the Bed.
Body: We believe that where you stay should be as moving as where you go. The YOLO Collective was born from a passion for the high-altitude trails and a desire to redefine mountain hospitality. We don’t just offer rooms; we curate environments where architecture meets the wild, and where every guest finds their own pace.

[Section 2: YOLO Social]

Headline: The Pulse of the Tribe.
Sub-headline: Energy. Connection. Modern Exploration.
Body: Designed for the digital nomad and the soul-searcher, YOLO Social is the heartbeat of our collective. It is a high-energy hub where shared maps turn into shared journeys. Here, the Wi-Fi is as strong as the coffee, and the common areas are designed to spark the conversations that define a trip.

The Vibe: High-contrast design, communal fires, and the unmistakable energy of the mountains.

[Section 3: YOLO Homes]

Headline: The Modern Sanctuary.
Sub-headline: Homely Warmth Meets Contemporary Design.
Body: YOLO Homes is our reimagining of mountain living. It is a space of "Curated Comfort"—where the scent of cedarwood meets the touch of premium linens. Designed for the traveler who seeks stillness, YOLO Homes offers private nooks, sun-drenched corners, and a level of intimacy that makes the Himalayas feel like they belong to you alone.

The Vibe: Soft natural light, tactile textures, and the quiet luxury of a mountain home.

[Section 4: YOLO Outdoors]

Headline: Luxury in the Wild.
Sub-headline: Sleep Beneath a Billion Stars.
Body: At YOLO Outdoors in Jispa, the boundary between you and the universe vanishes. Our luxury geodesic domes sit on the banks of the Bhaga River, offering a cinematic front-row seat to the Milky Way. This is glamping at its most architectural—weatherproof, sophisticated, and utterly immersive.

The Vibe: Riverside stillness, panoramic glass walls, and the raw beauty of the high desert.

[Section 5: The Curation]

Headline: Your Mountain Concierge.
Body: Luxury is in the details. Whether it’s a private breakfast by the river, a curated foraging walk with a local guide, or a secret trail known only to our hosts, we handle the logistics so you can handle the wonder. Every stay at a YOLO property includes access to our deep local knowledge and high-altitude expertise.

[Section 6: Final CTA]

Headline: Ready to find your center?
Button Text: SECURE YOUR STAY
Link: https://bookingengine.stayflexi.com/group-be/?groupId=28012

Design Notes for Antigravity:

Typography: Use Black (#000000) for all headlines. Use Skyblue (#74ACDF) only for the sub-headlines and the final CTA button.

Transitions: As the user scrolls from "Social" to "Homes," have the background images fade from vibrant community shots to soft, close-up textures of the home.

The WhatsApp Hook: Ensure the floating WhatsApp button is always visible during this scroll, labeled simply as "Inquire" or "Chat with a Host."
