1. BRAND CORE
Mission: To provide high-altitude, experience-led hospitality for the modern soul.

Tone of Voice: Sophisticated, intentional, warm, and grounded. We are the "well-traveled friend," not the "budget salesman."

Primary Keywords: Curated, Sanctuary, Architectural, Himalayan, Stillness, Community.

2. BRAND ARCHITECTURE
The YOLO Collective is a "House of Brands" with three distinct spirits:

A. YOLO SOCIAL (The Hostels)

Vibe: High-energy, social, and design-led.

Target: Digital nomads and solo travelers.

Visuals: High-contrast (Black/White), group interactions, communal cafes.

B. YOLO HOMES (The Modern Sanctuary)

Vibe: Homely, intimate, and slow-paced.

Target: Couples, families, and those seeking quiet comfort.

Visuals: Soft natural light, warm textures (wool/wood), "view-from-the-nook."

C. YOLO OUTDOORS (Luxury Riverside Domes)

Vibe: Epic, cinematic, and exclusive.

Target: Luxury seekers and milestone celebrations.

Visuals: "Blue Hour" photography, Milky Way backdrops, glowing architectural domes.

3. VISUAL STANDARDS
Skyblue (#74ACDF): Used for Call-to-Action buttons and the "Outdoors" brand mark. (Representing the Himalayan horizon).

Pure White (#ffffff): The primary background. Used to create "breathing room" and luxury.

Solid Black (#000000): For all typography, borders, and structural design.

Logo Usage:

Primary: Black wordmark + Skyblue icon.

Reverse: All White (for use on dark, cinematic photography).

Clear Space: Always maintain a border of empty space equal to the height of the "Y" around the logo.

4. WEBSITE DESIGN PLAN
Hero Sections: Use full-bleed, high-resolution imagery with minimalist White or Black text overlays.

Buttons: Skyblue (#74ACDF) background, Black text, sharp corners (0px border-radius).

Typography: Bold Geometric Sans-Serif for headings; Light Sans-Serif for body text.

Structure: A "Gateway" homepage leading to three separate landing pages for each sub-brand.

5. PREMIUM SERVICE STANDARDS
The Welcome: No "reception desks." At YOLO Homes and Domes, greetings should be done in a seating area with a local welcome drink.

Sensory Branding: Every property must have a signature scent (Cedarwood or Pine) and a curated ambient playlist.

Local Expertise: Staff are "Concierges," not "Receptionists." They must be able to recommend secret spots, not just tourist maps.

6. CONTENT STRATEGY
Pillar 1 (Architecture): Focus on the lines of the domes and the homes.

Pillar 2 (Nature): The Bhaga River, the night sky, the shifting snow.

Pillar 3 (The Feeling): Close-ups of textures—a steaming mug of coffee, a warm throw, or the local stone walls.
